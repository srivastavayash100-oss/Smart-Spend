📱 Smart Spend: The Behavioral Finance HUD
Smart Spend is a real-time spending awareness system designed to rewire money behavior through psychology and gamification. Unlike traditional trackers that provide post-spend analysis, this system acts as a Heads-Up Display (HUD) for your financial life.

🧠 The Philosophy
Most people don't overspend because they want to; they overspend because they aren't aware in the moment. Smart Spend is built on the 40-30-20-10 Rule, focusing on awareness over restriction and identity over guilt.

🚀 Key Systems
🎮 Trophy & League Engine: Budgeting is treated as a ladder. Users earn trophies and climb leagues (from Bronze to Legend) based on their monthly discipline and rule compliance.

🧩 Automated Continuity (Missed Month Logic): A robust system that ensures data integrity. If the app isn't opened for months, the engine automatically detects the gap, finalizes past periods, and injects neutral entries to keep the Trophy History unbroken.

🌊 Liquid-Fill HUD: A high-fidelity gaming interface featuring liquid-fill progress bars. The UI utilizes pulses and haptic feedback to signal spending velocity without using "shame-based" alerts.

🛡️ No-Shame Awareness: The system does not block payments or judge spending. It provides real-time "Health Bar" updates to help users recalibrate their behavior for the next cycle.

⚡ Performance-First Architecture: Built with optimized DOM rendering and event delegation, ensuring a lag-free experience even with high transaction volumes.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Frontend: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (Liquid-motion animations), JavaScript (ES6+).

Persistence: Secure LocalStorage Sync for offline-first, private data retention.

Core Logic: Dynamic 40-30-20-10 Rule Engine with Automated Time-Series Aggregation.
