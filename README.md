# 📱 Smart Spend: The Behavioral Finance HUD

> **Awareness over Restriction. Identity over Guilt.**

Smart Spend is a real-time spending awareness system designed to rewire money behavior through psychology and gamification. Unlike traditional trackers that provide post-spend analysis, this system acts as a **Heads-Up Display (HUD)** for your financial life.

## 🧠 The Philosophy
Most people don't overspend because they want to; they overspend because they aren't **aware** in the moment. Smart Spend is built on the **40-30-20-10 Rule**, focusing on awareness over restriction and identity over guilt.

## ⚡ Core Systems

### 🏆 Trophy & League Engine
Budgeting is treated as a competitive ladder. Users earn trophies and climb leagues based on their monthly discipline and rule compliance.
* **Leagues:** Bronze ➔ Silver ➔ Gold ➔ Crystal ➔ Master ➔ Champion ➔ Legend.

### 🧩 Automated Continuity (Missed Month Logic)
A robust system ensuring data integrity. If the app remains closed for months, the engine:
1. Automatically detects the time gap.
2. Finalizes past periods based on the last known state.
3. Injects neutral entries to keep the **Trophy History** unbroken.

### 🌊 Liquid-Fill HUD
A high-fidelity gaming interface featuring liquid-fill progress bars.
* **Haptic Feedback:** The UI utilizes pulses to signal spending velocity.
* **Visual Cues:** Dynamic bars change behavior as you approach limits, removing the need for "shame-based" push notifications.

## 🛡️ No-Shame Awareness
The system does not block payments or judge spending. It provides real-time **"Health Bar"** updates to help users recalibrate their behavior for the next cycle autonomously.
